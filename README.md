# Image-Classification-using-Traditional-Machine-Learning
This project uses a traditional machine learning approach to answer  this problem. Traditional ML classifiers are easy to understand and  implement, fast and provide good explanations of the data and  predictions. However, their performance is compromised when the  data is high dimensional and large. We have analysed and compared  ML algorithms, namely K Nearest Neighbours, Na√Øve Bayes, Random  Forest and Support Vector Machine to classify different yoga pose  images into appropriate asanas. We tried to improve the results by  techniques like feature extraction and edge detection by using Gabor  filters and Sobel kernels. The project describes the limitations of  traditional ML classifiers and suggests the need for deep learning  techniques to handle this problem more accurately.
